Part3 Layer-3 ¡°Shortest-Path Switching¡± Routing Application:

(1) Efficiency of Bellman-Ford algorithm in shortest path finding needs to be improved

(2) More tests should be conducted with more complex topology


Part4 Distributed Load Balance Routing Application:

(1) Stability of load balancers needs to be improved

(2) More tests should be conducted under high request load conditions
